    <p>Best recipe the day after a big ham supper!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 cup cubed fully cooked ham</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>⅓ pound processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cubed </li>
        <li>½ cup crushed potato chips </li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling
             water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 
             minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Mix egg noodles, ham, evaporated milk, cream of chicken soup, onion, and processed 
            cheese food in a 9x13-inch baking dish until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and cheese food is melted, about 1 hour. About 5 
            minutes before end of baking, sprinkle chips atop casserole and return to oven; bake 
            for 5 minutes more.</li>
